# Features

### Generic features

1. Colour
* The colours of the game chosen, represent the colours of the Earth and they were selected from [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/). These colours not only meet the "world tour" theme but are also eye catching for the younger target audience.

2. Font-family
* The font-family used throughout this game is "Bubblegum Sans" (see below image). The font was sourced from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). It was chosen because it has a non-formal, bold, appearance.

### Page specific 

1. Home page:

![home](assets/images/readme-images/home.png)

* The home page has a happy, cartoon, world character which is attractive for children and it also carries through the theme of this project. 
* Another aim of the cartoon character is to appear as though they are delivering the instructions of the game, which helps make the instructions easy to digest and less formal.
*  The button used to initiate the game has purposefully been named "Start tour" in order to keep the theme running through the project. It is designed to be bigger than the rest of the paragraph text to highlight its importance. When the button is hovered over, it turns green and the mouse pointer turns to a curser, this is to add some fun element to the button. 

2. Game page:

![game](assets/images/readme-images/game.png)

* The game page has a landmark question counter at the top of the page so that users can know how many questions they need to pass through before the game finishes.
* There is a timer below the landmark question counter to add in a challenge element to the game.
* The landmark image is sizeable so that the user can clearly see the landmark in order to decipher its location. 
* The buttons are styled in the same way as the start tour button on the home page to provide uniformity throughout the project.
* When a choice is correctly selected the button will go green and when a choice is incorrectly selected the button will go red. This provides a quick visual aid to the user about whether they had selected the right answer, without having to use much text. 







4. Buttons 
* All buttons have been designed so that they are big and eyecatching.
* For consistency they have all been styled with the same colour background.
* To give some fun effect to the buttons, a hover effect has been added to the 'Start tour', 'Tour again' and 'Home' buttons so that they change colour when you hover over them. 
* An additional feature of the buttons is that the mouse pointer changes to a curser when you pass over the buttons which further highlights the intent of the buttons.
